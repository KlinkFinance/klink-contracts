A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

KlinkToken

KlinkToken is a customizable ERC20 token smart contract built on the OpenZeppelin framework. It includes additional functionality for minting and burning tokens, all controlled by the contract owner.

Features

ERC20 Standard: Implements the widely used ERC20 token standard.

Minting: Allows the owner to mint new tokens.

Burning: Supports token burning, both directly by the owner and from specific accounts.

Ownership Control: Includes ownership functionality using OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract.

Deployment

The contract requires the following parameters during deployment:

name - The name of the token (e.g., "KlinkToken").

symbol - The symbol of the token (e.g., "KLINK").

initialSupply - The initial supply of tokens (in smallest units, e.g., wei).

Upon deployment, the entire initial supply will be minted to the deployer's address.

Functions

Constructor

``` 
constructor(
    string memory name,
    string memory symbol,
    uint256 initialSupply
)
```

Initializes the contract with a name, symbol, and initial supply of tokens.

Minting

function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner

Mints new tokens to the specified address. Can only be called by the contract owner.

Burning

Burn from Owner's Account

function burn(uint256 amount) public override onlyOwner

Burns a specified amount of tokens from the owner's account.

Burn from Specific Account

function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public override onlyOwner

Burns a specified amount of tokens from another account, reducing the allowance first.

Token Transfers

function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override

A hook that is called before any transfer of tokens, including minting and burning. It can be customized as needed.

Requirements

Solidity version: ^0.8.9

OpenZeppelin Contracts version: 4.9.6

Installation

Install the OpenZeppelin contracts package:

npm install @openzeppelin/contracts

Import the KlinkToken contract into your project and deploy it.
